# Implicit Function Renderer & Morphing

OpenGL implementation of Implicit Function Rendering, using the ray marching method.

- The algorithm is based on paper *Real-Time Ray Tracing of Implicit Surfaces on the GPU*

- Ray marching is implemented in Fragment Shader, with simple lighting & shadowing.

- FPS > 60fps on RTX 2070s.

- 3D morphing by interpolation between two implicit functions.

- Blob version of some basic mesh
